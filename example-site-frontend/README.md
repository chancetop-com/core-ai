### Start

1. confirm the root file `.npmrc` have input correctly.
2. install npm package.

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm i
```

3. run

We suggest use vite to running project. please note that the project will rebuild when the ‘vite.config.ts’ and 'package.json' changed. The first time running maybe slowly.Just wait a moment.

```js
yarn dev  (use vite - suggest)
or
yarn start  (use webpack)
```

```js
npm run dev  (use vite - suggest)
or
npm start  (use webpack)
```
